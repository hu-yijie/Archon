"""Prompt builders for Archon's plan / prover / review phases.

The actual ``claude`` invocation lives in :mod:`archon.agent`. This
module only constructs the prompt strings handed to the agent. The
session-end inspection helpers (which read the JSONL log after a run)
live in :mod:`archon.session_log`.

Design principle: anything the loop can do deterministically (read a
file, run a check, compute a summary) is injected INTO this module's
output rather than asked of the agent. The agent reads what's in
front of it; the agent does NOT mechanically "go read file X then
clear it". File-reading and file-clearing are the loop's job.

    Before flagging a ``\\leanok`` marker as suspicious (e.g. proof-block
    ``\\leanok`` on a sorry-bodied decl), check the state file:

      ``{state_dir}/sync_leanok-state.json``

    written by the ``sync_leanok`` phase between the prover and review.
    Its ``iter`` field tells you which iteration's tree the sync last
    ran against; ``sha`` pins the inner-git HEAD at that moment;
    ``chapters_touched`` lists chapters whose markers were modified.

    If ``iter`` equals the current review iteration, any ``\\leanok``
    the sync left in place reflects the script's deterministic verdict
    (file compiles, no attributable sorry under that decl) — flag it as
    "genuine laundering" only after auditing the Lean source yourself.
    If the file is missing or ``iter`` lags behind, the markers may
    simply be stale; note that ambiguity in your summary rather than
    raising a CRITICAL.

        ## ``\\leanok`` sync attribution

        Before flagging any proof-block ``\\leanok`` on a sorry-bodied
        decl as headline laundering, consult:

          {state_file}

        Schema: ``{{iter, sha, timestamp, added, removed, chapters_touched}}``.

        - ``iter`` equals this iteration ({iter_num:03d}) ⇒ sync has run for
          the current tree. Any remaining ``\\leanok`` is the script's
          deterministic verdict; only flag genuine laundering after a
          first-hand audit of the Lean source.
        - ``iter`` is older or the file is missing ⇒ markers may be stale.
          Note the ambiguity in ``summary.md`` instead of raising CRITICAL.""")
