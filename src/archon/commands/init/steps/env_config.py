"""Create `.archon/.env` and `.archon/config.json` with sensible defaults.

Both files are idempotent: existing user content is left alone. The
`.env` is gitignored by both outer (.archon/ rule) and inner git
(default-excludes rule, see InnerGit). config.json is tracked by inner
git so it's versioned with the project.
